# PlayDotNet
This is more of an experimental repo where I try everything which I find interesting for all the DotNet related applications (console/web/desktop etc.) and it's associated POCs.


# List of projects:

> ConsoleApp

> CoreWeb

> CoreWebAngular

> CoreWebEmpty

> CoreWebReact

> CoreWebReactRedux

> DesktopWindowsService

> EmployeeWeb

> Logger

> WebForms

> WebMVC


Note: 
- I will continue to add/update more relevant useful topics and concepts under this repo. 
- Your suggestions would be highly appreciated, if any.

# Happy Coding :)
